# Obstacle Avoidance
Different extremum seeking model-free hybrid controllers for multiple obstacle avoidance at unknown locations. The controller either uses classic averaging and singular perturbation theory or a neural network to achieve the extremum seeking dynamics. Both controllers use a Hybrid Model to achive multiple obstacle avoidance.

## Controller based on Classic Averaging and Singular Perturbation Theory
### Point-Mass Dynamics
### Nonholonomic Unicycle Dynamics

## Data-based Controller using a Neural Network
### Single Layer Neural Network
#### Quadratic Cost Function
#### 4th Degree Polynomial Cost Function
#### 6th Degree Polynomial Cost Function
#### 8th Degree Polynomial Cost Function
#### 10th Degree Polynomial Cost Function
### Double Layer Neural Network
### Single Layer Neural Network
#### Quadratic Cost Function
#### 4th Degree Polynomial Cost Function
#### 6th Degree Polynomial Cost Function
#### 8th Degree Polynomial Cost Function
#### 10th Degree Polynomial Cost Function
